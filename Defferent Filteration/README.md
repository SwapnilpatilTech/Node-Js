## 📦 Installation

Follow these step-by-step instructions to get the Product Management API up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the Repository** 📥
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd api-practical-task
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** 📦
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command will install all necessary packages including Express.js, Mongoose, and other dependencies.

3. **Environment Configuration** ⚙️
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure your environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section for details).

4. **Start the Development Server** ▶️
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Verify Installation** ✅
   The server will start on the port specified in your `.env` file. You should see a message indicating successful connection to MongoDB and server startup.

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Configure your environment by creating a `.env` file in the root directory with the following essential variables:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000

# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/product-management-api
